Two different sets of foliation, both recent and probably contemporary with the modern binding. Fol. 27, 53, 56-58, 78-79, 179-180, 355, 377-381, and 390 blank. Additional leaves of a smaller size are tucked in as follows: fol. 65A (between fol. 64 and fol. 65); fol. 67A (between fol. 66 and fol. 67); fol. 84A (between fol. 83 and fol. 84); fol. 161bis (also numbered as fol. 162A; between fol. 161 and fol. 162); and fol. 175A (between fol. 174 and fol. 175). What were once fol. 93, 100, 148, 182, 397, and 411, respectively, were torn out; their inner edges are still visible. Fol. 351, 352, 362, and 375 have completely disappeared. Other folios are missing as well: a careful perusal of the preserved text of Saint Bonaventure's Legenda minor Sancti Francisci shows that the chapter \"De stigmatibus sacris,\" starting on fol. 335r, is incomplete: it only contains lectiones I-IV and a fragment from the beginning of Lectio V, not continued on fol. 336r, which begins instead with the last part of Lectio II from the final chapter \"De transitu mortis.\" The manuscript as bound now is a florilegium comprised mostly of excerpts of Franciscan lore, copied by several different scribes at different times and, probably, at different locations. The folios now numbered 1 and 412 were perhaps the original flyleaves, part of the same manuscript written in Gothic bookhand, 13th century, containing the \"Homiliae in Evangelia\" of Gregory the Great; the text on fol. 1r can be identified as a fragment from St. Augustine's \"In Iohannis evangelium tractatus\" while the fragment on fol. 1v comes from St. Gregory the Great's \"Homiliarum5spectively.) On fol. 261v is mentioned a friar from Ortona, Italy: \"Frater Angelus de Ortona\", and two friars named Iacobus and Bartholinus, all of them involved in a loan related to this manuscript."}, "RobbinsMS51": {"Language": "Latin.", "Title": "Graviora aliquot dubia const[itution]is san[ctissi]mi D[omi]ni N[ost]ri Greg[ori]i XV de Romani Pontificis electione.", "Author": "Fagnani, Prospero,|d1588-1678.", "Place": "Italy", "Description": "Prospero Fagnani's treatise on the new regulations concerning papal elections established by Pope Gregory XV.

The later foliation in Arabic numerals at the tail edge of each folio (123-128; 129-136; 145-[149]), as well as the section headings in Roman numerals at the head edge of the first folio of each section (X, XI-XII, XV-XVI), indicate that these bifolia were once bound together. Before they were bound together into one codex (now disbound), a former owner folded some of the individual sections and wrote the title on the outside (fol. 6r, 18r), along with the numbers \"10\" and \"5,\" respectively."}}
